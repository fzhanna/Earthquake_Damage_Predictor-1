# Earthquake Damage Predictor

A data science contest, where we predict the damage caused by an earthquake on various structures. It is also one of the capstone project I submitted for the HarvardX Data Science certificate. 


This project consists of various R notebooks (broken into modules) and a pdf summary report was created using RMarkdown (see the Reports directory for details). 


Our model, a random forest created using the filtered dataset (see report for details) placed in the top 400, or the 11th percentile among all submissions.
